Lab 1 Project

Dataset 1 is from the World Happiness Report presented at the United Nations. 
Dataset 2 is from recent COVID pandemic and it gives statistics about different countries.

Created a data structure for these two datasets showing mean, variance and standard deviation. 
Getting the data and visualizing it by fetching the data in the ways possible from 1) CSV Files, 2) Scrapinng the Web, 3) by Web APIs.
Data gathered is stored locally in a MongoDB database for further usage and visualization.
Visualized different aspects about the datasets with interesting observations using line charts, bar charts, heatmaps and scatterplots.

Lab 3 Project

Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors ML Models. 

Naive Bayes: Used scikit-learn on the UCI wine dataset and implemented in a virtual environment.
Decision Trees: Used scikit-learn on the Diabetes dataset and implemented in a virtual environment.
K-Nearest Neighbors: Used scikit-learn on the UCI wine dataset and implemented in your own virtual environment.

Artificial Neural Networks and Clustering

Artificial Neural Network: 
Used keras on the Zillow's Home Value Prediction dataset and implemented in a virtual environment. 
Also used keras on the UCI wine dataset and implemented it in a virtual environment.

Clustering: 
Performed clustering using DBScan.
Also Used the AWS Cloud Watch dataset toperform clustering on time series data to observe anomalies. This dataset is part of Numenta Anomaly Benchmark.
Used implementation for multiple ec2 cpu utilization files.
