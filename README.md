Lab 1 Project

Dataset 1 is from the World Happiness Report presented at the United Nations. 
Dataset 2 is from recent COVID pandemic and it gives statistics about different countries.

Created a data structure for these two datasets showing mean, variance and standard deviation. 
Getting the data and visualizing it by fetching the data in the ways possible from 1) CSV Files, 2) Scrapinng the Web, 3) by Web APIs.
Data gathered is stored locally in a MongoDB database for further usage and visualization.
Visualized different aspects about the datasets with interesting observations using line charts, bar charts, heatmaps and scatterplots.

Lab 3 Project

Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors ML Models. 

Naive Bayes: Used scikit-learn on the UCI wine dataset and implemented in a virtual environment.
Decision Trees: Used scikit-learn on the Diabetes dataset and implemented in a virtual environment.
K-Nearest Neighbors: Used scikit-learn on the UCI wine dataset and implemented in your own virtual environment.

Artificial Neural Networks and Clustering

Artificial Neural Network: 
Used keras on the Zillow's Home Value Prediction dataset and implemented in a virtual environment. 
Also used keras on the UCI wine dataset and implemented it in a virtual environment.

Clustering: 
Performed clustering using DBScan.
Also Used the AWS Cloud Watch dataset toperform clustering on time series data to observe anomalies. This dataset is part of Numenta Anomaly Benchmark.
Used implementation for multiple ec2 cpu utilization files.

Project

This project is applying stylometric techniques to different 19th-century classical literature from other genres to gain insights into how literary styles evolved. 
The latter entails obtaining public-domain classical books and preprocessing them to analyze word frequency and distributions, sentence lengths, and stylistic properties using statistical methods and machine learning algorithms. 
The objectives of the project are to systematically examine and identify prevailing stylistic properties within a defined set of 19th-century classical literature using machine algorithms, NLP, and probability techniques. 
This involves a detailed exploration of literary styles, including word frequency, distributions, sentence lengths, feature extraction, topic modeling, and other properties, to discover hidden patterns and understand the stylistic properties of 19th-century literature. 
In addition, this project will demonstrate the potential benefits of using modern tools, such as machine learning, on old resources to provide new insights and perspectives.
